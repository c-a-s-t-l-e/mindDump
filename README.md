# mindDump

Journals and planning are important... so why not make things easier for yourself?

## What's a "Mind Dump"?

If you really can't get yourself to focus on planning out your day or week, 
why not do a mind dump?

Essentially, there are two easy steps:

1. Start writing or typing what's on your mind.

2. That's it.

## mindDump's Purpose

After a pretty big mind dump, there might be some handy stuff in there that you could
recycle for other purposes like generating new project ideas and implementing new 
strategies for the week. 

Sometimes you can get a lot of it yourself, but wouldn't it be nice to have
a handy-dandy tool to help you as well?

mindDump's that tool!
