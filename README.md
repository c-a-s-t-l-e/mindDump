# mindDump

Journals are important... so why not make things easier for yourself?

## What's a "Mind Dump"?

If you really can't get yourself to focus on planning out your day or week, 
why not do a mind dump?

Essentially, there are two easy steps:

1. Start writing or typing what's on your mind.

2. That's it.

## mindDump's Purpose

After a pretty big mind dump, there might be some handy stuff in there that you could
recycle for other purposes like figuring out what makes us tick.

Sometimes you can get a lot of it yourself, but wouldn't it be nice to have
a handy-dandy tool to help you as well?

mindDump's that tool!

## What Does This Project Entail?

There are three separable, mostly independent components to this project that are meant to be modified by the user.

These are:

1. [The mindDump Android App](android_app)
2. [The Journal Entry Processing Notebooks](model_notebook)
3. [The mindDump Analyser Web App]()
