hello my name is johnny and i am a junjor at byu idaho. i like baseball and am studying data science. I have six cats and all of them do not like me, but that is ok. I give them tuna every night while I read them a bedtime story. I then tell them how much I appreciate each of them individually. I first pet each of their heads. I then give them a fist-bump.
